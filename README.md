# Autoconf-Open-Source-Project-Assignment

This is a part of the Free and Open Source (FOSS) course which I took in my junior year in College of Engineering, Pune.

This example is for writing the makefile and generating the configure and other files.
The makefile which developers use for installing applications which produce a make file and configure file. And finally they
run make install.

This take a simple say.c and say.h program and rest magic is performed by using AUTOCONF TOOLS. 

All Linux enthusiasts must try this in order to understand how makefile really works.
